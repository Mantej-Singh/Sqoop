# Sqoop
Using sqoop to copy data from SQLServer to Hadoop


## Sqoop Introduction
Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data to and from structured datastores (SQL Server, MySQL) and Apache Hadoop.
You can use Sqoop to import data from external structured datastores into Hadoop Distributed File System or related systems like Hive and HBase.
It efficiently transfers bulk data between Hadoop and external data stores such as enterprise data warehouses, relational databases, etc.
Conversely, Sqoop can be used to extract data from Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as relational databases and enterprise data warehouses.

 
This is how Sqoop got its name – “SQL to Hadoop & Hadoop to SQL”
